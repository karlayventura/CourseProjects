*** Method overloading in java ***
-  When same method name exists in a class but with different numbers of parameters
   or different data type of parameters or different sequence of parameters.

* ADVANTAGES of method overloading:
- Flexibility of having same name methods in a class.
- End user gets the benefits that he/she does not need to remember different method names.

* RULES:
- We can overload the constructors
- We can overload the static methods as well
- We can overload the main method as well

* RULES for static methods:
- Static methods can't access instance fields directly
- Instance methods can access instance as well static fields directly
