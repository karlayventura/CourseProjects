* TOPIC : Method overriding

- Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in the parent class & child class
- We can only override a method if we have inheritance relationship between 2 classes.
- We cant override the private methods because they dont participate in inheritance.
- We cant override the constructors because they dont participate in inheritance.
