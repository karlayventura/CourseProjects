* Abstract classes in java

* What is an abstract class in java ?
   - Are the classes with abstract keyword
   - We use abstract classes to achieve abstraction.

* Abstraction:
   - Is the process of hiding implementation details & only showing the
     functionality to the end user.

* Advantages:
   1) Reduces the complexity.
   2) Improves the maintainability. (we divide the logic into parts)
   3) Can also enforce rules utp to a certain limit.

* Disadvantages:
   1) Classes get tightly coupled

Example:
class Dog{
   String name;
   static int legs=4;
   // Concrete class
}
public abstract class Phone{
 String make;
 String model:
 static boolean has5G=; // Static Can be in abstract class
}

* RULES :
- Abstract classes can have all the things that all regular classes do.
  but we can't create their objects directly & if a class is inheriting from the abstract class
  it must either provide the implementation for the abstract method or it must be declared abstract.

* NOT ALLOWED :
1) To have final & abstract keywords with a method at the same time.(Because of implementation)
2) To have static & abstract keywords with a method at the same time.
3) To have abstract keywords with fields(variables).
