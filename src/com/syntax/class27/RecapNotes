* Collections framework in java:

* Collection Framework:
- Collection of classes that help us manage & manipulate data in a better way.

1) ArraysList (Part of Collection framework)
- This class has many built-in methods like = add() remove() clear() ect.
- Dynamic(Changeable) & can adjust their size at run time.

~ SYNTAX:
  ArrayList<String> arrayList=new ArrayList<>();
~ BREAKDOWN:
  ArrayList = Name of the class
         <> = Diamond operator We specify the data type

*** Wrapper Classes:
- A class that Provides a way to use primitive data types as objects, when they can't be used.

~ SYNTAX:
  byte = Byte
  short = Short
  int = Integer
  double = Double
  char = Character

* Why wrapper classes?
1) We get built in methods
2) A lot of frameworks dont support primitives

* When to use primitive:
1) When we care about memory, because primitives occupy 4 times less memory as compared to wrapper.
2) Performance

* When to use wrapper class?
1) When we care about our ease.
