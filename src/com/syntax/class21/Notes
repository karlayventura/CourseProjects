TOPIC : super keyword

* What is super.(keyword)?
- Is like "this." (keyword), but it refers to the parent class object.
- We can use the super keyword in 3 different way.

* 3 Ways to use super keywords.
1) Used To access the super class variables,
   if we have same named variables in super class and base class

2) If we have same method names in parent & child class,
   we can use the super keyword to access the parent class method,
   otherwise by default java refers to child class methods.

3) As constructor DO NOT participate in inheritance,
   we can use super() to call the constructors from the parent class.

* RULES:
1) If we have a constructor in the parent class that takes 2 argument
   we must have a constructor inside the child class that at least takes those 2 arguments.

2) We cant use this() & super() inside the same constructor.

3) super can't be used in static methods.
