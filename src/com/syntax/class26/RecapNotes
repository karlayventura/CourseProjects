***** TOPIC: Abstraction & Interface *****

* Abstraction in java :
    - Hiding the implementation details & providing the functionality to end user.

* 2 methods to achieve abstraction :
    1) Abstract classes = (Are classes with abstract keyword)
    2) interfaces = (Are the contracts that we create with the help of interface keyword)

**** How to decide which one to use ? ****
    - Prefer the interface over abstract classes
ABSTRACT = If 2 or more classes are closely related to each other -> go with abstract classes.
     EX: If we have to create a lion class & horse class =
         we should go with abstract class & create an animal abstract class.

INTERFACE = If 2 classes are not related to each other
     EX: An apple & a cloth =
         We should create an interface for that like if we want to have a behavior washAble interface

* Encapsulation :
- It is the 4th pillar of OOPS.
- It provides security and better control over the data of the class.

- Create classes
- Inside we create private fields/variables
- Getter & setter methods = We set & get the values of the class fields with the help of these methods.
                            Instead of accessing & modifying them directly.
