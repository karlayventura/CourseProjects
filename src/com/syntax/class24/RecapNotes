***** Method Overriding in Java *****
* Method Overriding:
- Happens when we have same name methods in parent & child classes.

* Benefits:
1) Flexibility if we don't like something from the parent class,
   We can override it & can provide our own implementation.

2) Same method can act differently depending upon the object on which we call it.

* RULES:
1) Without inheritance method overriding is NOT possible.
2) method signature should be the same in parent class & in child class.
3) if something does not participate in inheritance we cant override it.
   like = Constructor & Private methods.
4) We can increase the visibility in the child class but we CANNOT decrease it.
* EXAMPLE = We can go from default or protected to public, but we cant do the reverse.
5) We can't override a static method but we can redeclare it.
* EXAMPLE =  main method cant be overridden as it is static.
6) We cant have different return type in the child class, it must be same as of parent class.
