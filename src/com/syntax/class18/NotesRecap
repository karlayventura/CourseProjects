* Access Modifiers in Java:
- Allow us to control the visibility of class members meaning -> (Fields,methods,Constructors ect)
  & classes itself in java.

 * Fields = Are ONLY Instance Variables *

- There are 4 (access levels) & 3 (keywords) that we use to define these access level.
- 4th level is applied when we don't use any access modifier keyword (default)

* Access levels from MOST restricted -> LESS restricted are:
1) private (Is also a keyword)
2) default (NOT a Keyword ONLY default access level)
3) protected (Is also a keyword)
4) public (Is also a keyword)

* RULES:
1) We should always PREFER -> (private access) modifier for the fields.
   Because fields contain the data & the methods of your class might use that data to perform some tasks,
   If we don't perform checks before setting the values to these fields our classes & methods might
   misbehave, also the access of the data should be restricted so that not everyone can access the data.

2) We CANNOT use access modifiers with local variables.
