* TOPIC: ACCESS MODIFIERS

-------- Access Modifiers --------
- Are keywords in java that defines from where a certain variable, method or a class ect can be accessed.
- There are 4 types of access in java that we can define using 3 keywords.

-------- 4 Types of access --------
1. Private = Accessed only in same class
2. Default (Applied when no keyword is used) = Accessed ONLY from same package
3. Protected = Accessed in same package
4. Public = Accessed anywhere in same project

-------- 3 Types of define keywords --------
1. Private
2. Protected
3. Public

-------- Definition of the 4 Access --------
* private Access (keyword is private): * MOST RESTRICTED ACCESS *
- When we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods or classes
  They can ONLY be accessed within that class.

* Default Access (Applied when we don't use any keyword):
- When we DONT use any of the keywords, default access is applied by java
  to those variables methods or classes ect.
  Which means these things can only be accessed from the same package.

* Protected Access (We use the protected class):
- When protected access is applied class members(Variables method ect) can be accessed
  From other packages, But only in the classes that participate in inheritance.

* Public Access (Public keyword):
- Means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project.
