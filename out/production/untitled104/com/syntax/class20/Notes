TOPIC : Inheritance in java

* What is inheritance?
- Its a mechanism in java through which a child class gets the properties and
  methods from a parent class.
* mechanism = a system of parts working together

* Benefits:
1) Saves time to code.
2) Code duplication is reduced.
3) Execution time is faster.

* Disadvantages:
1) Classes are tightly coupled, If we change something in parent class it is also change in child class.

* Types if inheritance:
- There are 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them.
1) Single
2) Hierarchical
3) Multilevel
4) Multiple (NOT supported in java)

1) Single inheritance:
- We have ONLY 1 parent class & one child class or
  ONLY 2 classes that participate in inheritance 1 as child & 1 as parent
SYNTAX:
class Parent{
}
class Child extends Parent{
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Hierarchical inheritance:
- We have a single parent class & multiple child classes
SYNTAX:
class Parent{
}
class Child1 extends Parent{
}
class Child2 extends Parent{
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Multilevel inheritance:
- We have multiple levels of inheritance.
Example: if we have classes A B C
         Class C -> will be inherited from B
         Class B -> will be inherited from A
SYNTAX:
class A{
}
class B extends A{
}
class C extends B{
}
