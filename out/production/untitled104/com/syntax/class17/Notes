* TOPIC: Types of Variables

------ 3 Types of variables -----
1. Local Variable = A variable is inside a method, loop, switch or any other block of code.
2. Instance Variable = A variable outside a method but inside a class
3. Static Variable = A variable outside a method but inside a class and Has static keyword with it.

------------ Example ---------------

Class Variables {

int age=10; // Instance Variable

static double weight=25.5; // Static Variable

void method(){
String name="Karla"; // Local Variable

  }
}

-------------- When to use which type of variable? --------------
1. Local Variables : Should always be preferred over -> Instance & Static variables.
              Why? = Because they occupy the computers memory for very short amount of time.
                     As soon as there purposed is served java destroys them.
* Pros:
- Saves memory
* Cons:
- NOT accessible outside of a method/block of code

2. Instance Variable : When we want to share something in multiple methods of a class
                       & the information is expected to be different from object to object.
* Pros:
- Accessible in all the methods of a class.
* Cons:
- Occupy the computers memory for longer than local variables.

3. Static Variable : When we know that information will stay the same for all the objects in the class.
* Pros:
- Single memory location for all objects of a class.
* Cons:
- Stay longer in the memory & Can hold only 1 value at a time.
