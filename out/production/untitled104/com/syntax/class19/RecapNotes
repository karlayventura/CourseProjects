************ CONSTRUCTOR IN JAVA ************
What is Constructor?:
- A special block of code (Similar to  methods) that initialize
  the objects of a class.

* RULES:
1) NAMING CONSTRUCTOR: MUST be same name of the class.
2) RETURN TYPE: DO NOT have return/void types.
3) NON ACCESS MODIFIERS: CAN NOT have non access modifiers like (static, final, ect)
4) ACCESS MODIFIERS: Can use (public, private, protected) with constructors.
5) DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR: Applied by compiler, when we don't write a constructor in class.
6) MULTIPLE CONSTRUCTORS: We can have in a class, but their number of arguments sequence of
                          argument or type of argument should be different. ????
7) If we have (multiple constructors) then java decides which constructor to call
   based on the parameters we pass.
